Tracing code:
current issues 9/19/2024:

- The tester script that I added to each each assignment is causing issues. --> Printing out too much and causing issues. When testers are commented out, then the student's assignment can be run using hasattr method.

- What makes sense for me is to first
  Test all of the user methods,
  Record input and store (maybe csv)
  Work with data after that is complete.

For the testers: 
    Record count, record which were correct and record any errors that were seen.
