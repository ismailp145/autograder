# Auto Grader Script

This project is an auto grader script designed to automate the process of grading assignments for a course. The script follows a series of steps to read each assignment, test the methods against provided input, assign a score based on the output, use a Language Model (LLM) to determine issues in the code, provide feedback to students, and automatically input the feedback into their inbox.

## Features

- **Reading Assignments**: The script includes a function to read each assignment, allowing for easy access to the code.

- **Testing Methods**: The script provides a function to test the methods of each assignment against provided input, ensuring correctness of the output.

- **Scoring**: A scoring function is implemented to assign a score to each assignment based on the correctness of the output.

- **Language Model (LLM)**: The script utilizes a Language Model to analyze the code and identify potential issues or errors.

- **Feedback Generation**: Using the LLM, the script generates feedback for each assignment, providing students with valuable insights and suggestions for improvement.

- **Automatic Inbox Input**: The script automatically inputs the generated feedback into the students' inbox, streamlining the communication process.

## Usage

To use the auto grader script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the necessary libraries are imported.

2. Define the functions required for reading assignments, testing methods, assigning scores, using the LLM for feedback generation, and automatically inputting feedback into the inbox.

3. Implement the main function to execute the grading process, which includes calling the defined functions in the appropriate order.

4. Call the main function to start the auto grading process.
